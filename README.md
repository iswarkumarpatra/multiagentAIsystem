## üß† Problem Statement

Modern e-commerce platforms struggle to deliver personalized product recommendations due to manual, static, and non-adaptive systems. These outdated systems:
- Rely on rule-based segmentation
- Lack scalability and real-time adaptability
- Result in generic suggestions and reduced customer engagement

### üí° Goal
To build a **multi-agent AI system** that provides **hyper-personalized recommendations** by dynamically learning from user behavior and product metadata in real-time.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Our Solution: Multi-Agent Recommendation Architecture

Our architecture is composed of **three autonomous agents**, each specializing in a key aspect of personalization:

1. **Customer Agent**:
   - Tracks user behavior: browsing history, product clicks, purchase patterns, demographics
   - Builds dynamic user profiles updated in real-time
   - Stores data in a shared SQLite database

2. **Product Agent**:
   - Manages product metadata: tags, price, category, popularity
   - Generates embeddings using **Ollama-based on-prem LLMs**
   - Updates product vector space in SQLite for similarity matching

3. **Recommendation Agent**:
   - Central decision-maker that fetches user and product data
   - Utilizes **Gemma-2B model**, collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and reinforcement learning
   - Delivers intelligent, personalized product recommendations

All agents **collaborate via a shared SQLite database**, enabling continuous learning and memory retention.
